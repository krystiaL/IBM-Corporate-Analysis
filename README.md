# IBM Long-term trend analysis
A comprehensive long-term trend analysis on IBM using data sourced from the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) database. 
Leveraging EDGAR data queries, I was able to retrieve relevant financial information, such as SEC filings and financial reports, to generate source data files to aid my research thesis. These files serve as the foundation for rigorous data manipulation and analysis, enabling the extraction of significant insights into IBM's performance over time and to answer my core thesis objectives (tba after thesis completion). The repository further includes functions for data visualization, allowing users to create informative and visually appealing representations of the extracted analysis. 

Whether you're an investor, analyst, or researcher, this repository empowers you to delve deep into IBM's historical data and uncover valuable insights for informed decision-making.
